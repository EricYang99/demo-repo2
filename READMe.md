# Demo 2
cd ../demo-repo2 
    this command line allows us to move to this file
git init
    allows us to make a file a git file

This part is being changed for testing

Inside of the local github app is soooooooo much easier
    create or modify the locals

    use "git add ." or "git add "file name" "

    use "git status" to check for changes

    We have to then commit the code on the bottom left of the github app
        The commit must have a message

    we can then just push the changes on the git hub app 
        It will push the code based on the branch we are in, I think we are in the main
        The "push origin" button will appear in the middle of the screen after we have commited the code
